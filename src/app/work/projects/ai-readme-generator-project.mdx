## Overview

**AI README Generator** helps developers produce a tidy, skimmable README by pasting a **public GitHub repository URL**. The app inspects key files (e.g., `package.json`, config files, existing `README` if present), extracts signals about features and stack, then composes a structured markdown draft you can edit and download.

## How It Works

1. **Input URL** – Validate format and public visibility.  
2. **Analyze** – Fetch metadata, important files/folders, dependencies, and scripts.  
3. **Draft** – An AI prompt assembles sections: title, description, features, tech stack, install/run, env, contribution, and license.  
4. **Preview** – Review the markdown, tweak copy, then **Download** as `README.md`

## Key Features

- **One-click analysis** of any public repo.
- **Standardized README layout** (badges, summary, features, stack, installation, usage, env, architecture, contributing, license).
- **Tech Stack detection** from dependencies, config, and folder conventions.
- **Layout presets** (Minimal / Docs-style / OSS) for consistent headings and order.
- **Live preview** before export.
- **Export to file** or **copy to clipboard**.
- **URL validation & basic rate limiting**.
- **Accessible dark UI** with clean typography.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router, RSC, Server Actions)** — server-side fetching & generation.  
- **TypeScript** — end-to-end type safety.  
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** — consistent, composable UI.  
- **Zod** — input validation and schema guards.  
- **GitHub REST/fetch** — metadata + important file retrieval (public repos).  
- **AI provider** — summarization and structured draft generation.

## Architecture

- **/app** — routes for input, analysis, preview, and download.  
- **Server Actions**  
  - `analyzeRepo(url)` → fetch + parse metadata, normalize signals  
  - `draftReadme(data, preset)` → produce markdown draft  
- **Guards** — URL sanitization, GitHub domain checks, minimal rate limiting.  
- **Client state** — kept lean; heavy work happens on the server for stability.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Cross-project consistency**: Different repo shapes required a **section schema** and **fallback rules** when signals are sparse.  
- **Signal noise in large repos**: Implemented **file importance scoring** (prioritize `package.json`, lockfiles, `src/`, `apps/`, `packages/`, existing README).  

## Outcome

- Drafting a solid README now takes **seconds**, cutting initial documentation time by ~70–90%.  
- The consistent structure improves collaboration and onboarding for contributors.  
- Used across multiple personal and side projects before publishing to GitHub/LinkedIn.

## Next Steps

- **Popular templates** (CLI tool, library, monorepo, React Native app).  
- **Auto badges** (CI status, coverage, version).  
- **Optional LICENSE & CODE_OF_CONDUCT** scaffolding.
