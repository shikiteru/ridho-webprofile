## Overview

**MyCash** helps you record daily transactions in seconds and keep everything synced to **your** Google Spreadsheet. No complex setup—paste a sheet URL, enter your **access key**, and start tracking. As a **PWA**, MyCash works great on mobile and desktop, supports offline usage, and generates tidy monthly summaries and charts.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Spreadsheet** — Paste a valid Google Sheets URL (you own the file).  
2. **Access Key Auth** — Enter your personal access key to open the dashboard.  
3. **Record Transactions** — Add income/expenses with category, amount, notes.  
4. **Monthly View** — See totals, charts, and filters (by date, category, method).  

## Key Features

- **Google Sheets sync (read/write)** — your data remains in your own spreadsheet.
- **Access-key authentication** — simple, cookie-based session; no emails/passwords.
- **PWA** — installable, responsive UI, and **offline** capture with sync on reconnect.
- **Fast entry** — minimal form; typical transaction < 10 seconds.
- **Monthly reports** — income vs expense, category breakdowns, and trends.
- **Filters** — by date range, category, type, and payment method.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router, RSC, Server Actions)** — secure server-side reads/writes to Sheets.  
- **TypeScript** — end-to-end types for reliability.  
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** — clean, accessible components.  
- **next-pwa / Service Worker** — installable app, offline cache, fast startup.  
- **Zod** — validation for inputs (URL, transaction payloads).  
- **Google Sheets API** — structured read/write to specific ranges/tabs.

## Architecture

- **/app**  
  - `/` — connect screen (Sheet URL + Access Key).  
  - `/dashboard` — transactions table, quick-add form, charts & filters.
- **Server Actions**  
  - `connectSheet(url, key)` — validate URL, set session cookie.  
  - `createTransaction(payload)` — append to sheet with server-side validation.  
  - `listTransactions({ month })` — read and normalize rows for UI & charts.  
- **Guards & Middleware** — access-key session check, basic rate limiting.  
- **Data Model (Sheet columns)** — `Date, Description, Category, Type, Amount, Method, Notes`.  
- **PWA** — precache shell, background sync for queued writes when offline.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Keeping Sheets fast & consistent** — implemented batched writes and strict schemas to avoid broken formulas and mixed types.  
- **Auth without accounts** — access-key sessions proved effective for solo users and small teams while keeping friction low.  

## Outcome

- Users can onboard in **under 1 minute** and record transactions in **< 10 seconds**.  
- Monthly overviews reduce manual spreadsheet work and make reviews effortless.  

## Next Steps

- **Recurring transactions & rules** (auto-categorize).  
- **Receipt capture (camera/OCR)** with attachment link to each row.  
- **Budget goals & alerts** per category.  
- **Team access** with role-based keys (read-only vs editor).
